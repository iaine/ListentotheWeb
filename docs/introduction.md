## Web Science Sonification workshop

### What is Sonification?

Sonification is the use of non-speech audio to represent data (Kramer et al., 1997). 

A popular link for sonification comes from hte Web Science domain: Hatnote's [Listen to Wikipedia](http://listen.hatnote.com/). 

### Audification and Musification

Audification is a nearly direct mapping of data to audio (Kramer, 1994), such as a seismograph or Geiger counter. 

Audification is useful is time is an immediate concern.

An example comes from the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) [experiments](https://gwosc.org/audio/) or Janna Levin's Black Hole Blues and Other Songs from Outer Space (2016).

Musification is the application of musical terms, such polyphony, to the representation. 

The boundaries between these and sonification are some what porous
