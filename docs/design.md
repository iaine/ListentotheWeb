## Design

In the introduction, various design approaches were mentioned. 

What approaches might be useful in web science? 

Is this only temporal? Are there other relationships?

In an earlier workshop paper, myself and a co-author measured the packets on varying devices to think about how they work with the network (Emsley & Chamberlain, 2021).

### How might we want to present data?

We could use audio graphs, such as line charts to show relationships over time (Emsley, I., De Roure, D. and Chamberlain, A, 2017).

You can also think about more in depth sounds, such as using noise for sonifications of networks (Emsley, I., De Roure, D. and Chamberlain, A, 2017).
