## Listen to the Web

Sonification presents challenges in how to design sonic representations and how to listen to them. A central question is that of "How do we listen to the Web?". This workshop aims to raise such as questions and to consider inclusivity, for instance by considering the global South and whether digital divides can be heard as well. Sound can make the data accessible to visually impaired researchers.  We aim to develop a community to support sonification and audio efforts in Web Science that will develop tools, techniques, and educational material.

We are interested in interdisciplinary insights from digital humanities, sound studies, computational social science, and web science to help identify the type of data that might be sonified, techniques that are being used, and what might be heard within the sounds. The insights from this workshop will help share practice from current projects while helping to identify future research directions. 

## Call for Submissions

We invite presentations, demos, and papers about experiences or provocations in this area. 

Topics include, but not limited to:

* Sonification, musification or audification

* Modelling 

* Designs and patterns 

* Inclusive Design Approaches 

* Uncertain and Incomplete Data 

* Temporality 

* Machine Listening 

* Tools and techniques 

* Explaining Computational Models, not limited to Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning 

* Sonic Epistemology

* Listening 

* Sonifying the usage and evolution of the Web in a global context

## Activities

The session will begin with short presentations, such as paper or audio of about 10 minutes before moving to a working session to develop resources and links.

## Dates

The deadline is midnight April 4th using Anywhere on Earth time.

We aim to send responses after April 12th. 

If your paper is to be included in the companion collection of the ACM WebSci24 proceedings, you will need to adhere to the schedule for the publication of the overall proceedings. Camera-ready papers before 24 April 2024. This is a strict deadline, and the conference will not be able to include any papers after this date.


## Submissions

Please submit your abstract (300 words) to EasyChair:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sonifywebsci24

Papers should be up to 5 pages (including references, appendices, etc.). 

All papers should adopt the current ACM SIG Conference proceedings template (acmart.cls). Please submit papers as PDF files using the ACM template, either in Microsoft Word format (available at https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template under “Word Authors”) or with the ACM LaTeX template on the Overleaf platform, which is available at https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computing-machinery-acm-sig-proceedings-template/bmvfhcdnxfty. In particular; please ensure that you are using the two-column version of the appropriate template.
