## Listen to the Web

Sonification presents challenges in how to design sonic representations and how to listen to them. A central question is that of "How do we listen to the Web?". This workshop aims to raise such as questions and to consider inclusivity, for instance by considering the global South and whether digital divides can be heard as well. Sound can make the data accessible to visually impaired researchers.  We aim to develop a community to support sonification and audio efforts in Web Science that will develop tools, techniques, and educational material.

We are interested in interdisciplinary insights from digital humanities, sound studies, computational social science, and web science to help identify the type of data that might be sonified, techniques that are being used, and what might be heard within the sounds. The insights from this workshop will help share practice from current projects while helping to identify future research directions. 

## Call for Submissions

We invite presentations, demos, and papers about experiences or provocations in this area. 

Topics include, but not limited to:

* Sonification, musification or audification

* Modelling 

* Designs and patterns 

* Inclusive Design Approaches 

* Uncertain and Incomplete Data 

* Temporality 

* Machine Listening 

* Tools and techniques 

* Explaining Computational Models, not limited to Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning 

* Sonic Epistemology

* Listening 

* Sonifying the usage and evolution of the Web in a global context

## Activities

The session will begin with short presentations, such as paper or audio of about 10 minutes before moving to a working session to develop resources and links.
